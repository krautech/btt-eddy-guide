# Installation of EDDY USB V1 - Last Updated 29th May 2024


> [!WARNING]  
> [KAMP aka Klipper-Adaptive-Meshing-Purging](https://github.com/kyleisah/Klipper-Adaptive-Meshing-Purging) should be removed from your klipper prior to using Eddy. Please comment out the include line. ie ```#[include ./KAMP/adaptive_meshing.cfg]``` from your KAMP_SETTINGS.cfg
>
> Instead KAMP has been integrated into klipper as of January 2024 and you should use the ADAPTIVE=1 option in your BED_MESH_CALIBRATION calls. You can find more [Information on Adaptive Mesh Here](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Mesh.html#adaptive-meshes)

> [!WARNING]
> As it stands, Eddy requires the use of BTT's fork of klipper found [HERE](https://github.com/bigtreetech/klipper). This is included in the guide under steps 13.
> 
> This will be merged into mainline klipper at some stage and the guide will be updated once it happens. Until then this is a STRICT REQUIREMENT.

## Compiling Firmware
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please make sure you're MCU/devices are UP-TO-DATE with the latest versions of klipper firmware before attempting this. If you don't you may have issues with firmware errors. If in doubt, a clean install of klipper firmware on your devices can help limit any potential issues.
> 
1. SSH into raspberry PI or your host device
2. Type
```
cd ~/klipper
make menuconfig
```
3. Use these settings to compile the firmware.
![Firmware Image](https://github.com/krautech/btt-eddy-guide/blob/main/images/eddy-pi/compile.png?raw=true)
4. Once set, hit 'Q' and when asked, select yes to save.
5. Type ```make``` to compile.
6. Disconnect power to Eddy
7. Push and hold boot button on Eddy (Its next to where the cable plugs in) and at the same time, plug in the cable to your Raspberry Pi
![Boot Image](https://github.com/krautech/btt-eddy-guide/blob/main/images/eddy-pi/boot.png?raw=true)
8. SSH into host device
9. Type ```lsusb``` into the command line. You should see eddy. 

![LSUSB Image](https://github.com/krautech/btt-eddy-guide/blob/main/images/eddy-pi/lsusb.png?raw=true)

10. Type  ```cd ~/klipper``` into command line
11. Type ```make flash FLASH_DEVICE=2e8a:0003```
Remember to change 2e8a:0003 to your device ID you found in step 9
12. Type  ```ls /dev/serial/by-id/*```  into the command line. The found device will be what you enter into your klipper config under [mcu eddy] for the Serial variable.
> [!NOTE]
> You need to change from the main branch of klipper to BTTs branch as discussed in the warning at the top of the page. This is only temporary and will be updated accordingly.
> 
> Still accurate as of **29th May 2024**.
13. Change to BTT klipper by entering the following via SSH
```
git remote add eddy https://github.com/bigtreetech/klipper
git fetch eddy
git checkout eddy/eddy
```
14. Type into command line ```sudo reboot```

## Printer Configuration
> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### Z Endstop
> If you want to enable Z-Homing/Endstop, under your [stepper_z] in printer.cfg change ```endstop_pin: PA5``` to ```endstop_pin: probe:z_virtual_endstop``` and comment out or remove ```position_endstop: 0```
> 
15. Add the following to your printer.cfg making sure to adjust for your bed size and probe position
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Adjust your **x_offset** and **y_offset** to match your probe position relative to your nozzle. You can do that following these steps found [HERE](https://www.klipper3d.org/Probe_Calibrate.html)

## 2. Live Current Calibration
16. Place Eddy Approx. 20mm above the bed.
17. From Mainsail or Fluidd run command  ```LDC_CALIBRATE_DRIVE_CURRENT CHIP=btt_eddy```
18. Type ```SAVE_CONFIG``` to save the drive currant to your config
## 3. Z Offset Calibration
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If using a printer with Quick Gantry Leveling (Voron etc) perform it now to ensure the gantry is level and to prevent the nozzle rubbing into the bed.
 
19. Home X and Y axes with command ```G28 X Y```
20. Make sure you dont have a bed heightmap loaded.
21. Move Nozzle to Centre of the bed with ```G0 X125 Y125 F6000``` (adjust for your bed size)
22. Start Manual Z-Offset Calibration by typing ```PROBE_EDDY_CURRENT_CALIBRATE CHIP=btt_eddy ``` (TIP: Go a little lower than you normally would)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Perform another Quick Gantry Leveling (Voron etc)
23. Once completed use ```SAVE_CONFIG```
## 4. Bed Mesh Calibration
24. Home All Axes
25. Use command ```BED_MESH_CALIBRATE METHOD=scan SCAN_MODE=rapid``` [Parameters](#bed-mesh-calibrate-parameters)
26. Once completed use ```SAVE_CONFIG```
## 5. Temperature Compensation Calibration (Eddy USB ONLY)
> [!CAUTION]
> The following steps (27-36) are for Eddy USB Only. Eddy Coil doesnt have temperature compensation so these steps should be disregarded.

27. Home All Axes and move Z 10 above bed
28. Set idle timeout ```SET_IDLE_TIMEOUT TIMEOUT=36000```
29. Record ambient temp of the BTT Eddy Sensor
![Eddy Temperature](https://github.com/krautech/btt-eddy-guide/blob/main/images/eddy-pi/eddy-temp.jpg?raw=true)
30. Set max temp for bed (i.e 100c) and set typical temperature for hotend (200c)
31. Wait for BTT Eddy temp to stabilize then record temp.
32. Return to room temp by turning off bed and hotend
> [!TIP]
> If you have a high range to test between ambient and max eddy temp from step 25, you can change the value of STEP=3 to STEP=5 to save you some time. Ideally you want as many calibration points as possible for the best use of eddy but I found for range between 30c-50c a STEP value of 3 was sufficient

33. Run ```PROBE_DRIFT_CALIBRATE PROBE=btt_eddy TARGET=50 STEP=3```  (target should be the temp you recorded of the max recorded temp from step 31.
34. Using [the paper method](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html#the-paper-test) adjust your Z offset.
35. Turn on your heat bed and nozzle to same values as step 30
36. As Eddy temp rises at each 3c (STEP=3) increment, you will automatically be asked to set the z-offset when prompted using the paper test.
> [!NOTE]
> By default the calibration procedure will request a manual probe every 2C between samples until the TARGET is reached. The temperature delta between samples can be customized by setting the STEP parameter in PROBE_DRIFT_CALIBRATE.
>
> The following additional gcode commands are available during drift calibration.
>
>    ```PROBE_DRIFT_NEXT``` may be used to force a new sample before the step delta has been reached.
>
>    ```PROBE_DRIFT_COMPLETE``` may be used to complete calibration before the TARGET has been reached.
>
>    ```ABORT``` may be used to end calibration and discard results.
>

> [!TIP]
> You might not reach your target temperature, thats okay. You can end the test by using command ```PROBE_DRIFT_COMPLETE``` to finish.

37. Youre all done! :)

Make sure you LIVE ADJUST your z-offset with your first print to really home it in.

# Bed Mesh Calibrate Parameters
Some probes, such as Eddy, are capable of
"scanning" the surface of the bed.  That is, these probes can sample a mesh
without lifting the tool between samples.  To activate scanning mode, the
`METHOD=scan` probe parameter should be passed in the `BED_MESH_CALIBRATE`
gcode command.

To accommodate these probes the following additional `probe_parameters` are
available to `BED_MESH_CALIBRATE`:

- `SCAN_MODE=[detailed | rapid]`:  Choses the scan mode.  The `detailed` mode
  will pause and collect samples at each probe point.  The `rapid` mode will
  travel on a continuous path with no pauses, collecting samples near each probe
  point.
- `SCAN_SPEED=[speed] `: The maximum X/Y travel velocity of the tool when
  performing a scan.  The default is the value of the `speed` option in the
  configuration.
- `SAMPLE_TIME=[time]`:  The time, in seconds, the tool pauses for sample
  collection in `detailed` scan mode.  The default is .1 seconds.
- `SAMPLES_RESULT=[option]`: The type of averaging to perform on collected
  samples.  Available options are:
  - `standard`: All collected samples are averaged.
  - `centered`: Samples are sorted by value.  The first and last quarters
    are discarded and the remaining samples are averaged.
  - `weighted`: Samples closer to the desired probe location are assigned
    more weight in the average than samples farther from the location.

# Bed Mesh Scan Height

The scan height is set by the `horizontal_move_z` option in `[bed_mesh]`.  In
addition it can be supplied with the `BED_MESH_CALIBRATE` gcode command via the
`HORIZONTAL_MOVE_Z` parameter.

The scan height must be sufficiently low to avoid scanning errors.  Typically
a height of 2mm (ie: `HORIZONTAL_MOVE_Z=2`) should work well, presuming that the
probe is mounted correctly.

It should be noted that if the probe is more than 4mm above the surface then the
results will be invalid.  Thus, scanning is not possible on beds with severe
surface deviation or beds with extreme tilt that hasn't been corrected.

# Rapid (Continuous) Scanning

When performing a `rapid` scan one should keep in mind that the results will
have some amount of error.  This error should be low enough to be useful on
large print areas with reasonably thick layer heights.  Some probes may be
more prone to error than others.

It is not recommended that rapid mode be used to scan a "dense" mesh.  Some of
the error introduced during a rapid scan may be gaussian noise from the sensor,
and a dense mesh will reflect this noise (ie: there will be peaks and valleys).

Bed Mesh will attempt to optimize the travel path to provide the best possible
result based on the the configuration.  This includes avoiding faulty regions
when collecting samples and "overshooting" the mesh when changing direction.
This overshoot improves sampling at the edges of a mesh, however it requires
that the mesh be configured in a way that allows the tool to travel outside
of the mesh.


```
[bed_mesh]
speed: 120
horizontal_move_z: 5
mesh_min: 35, 6
mesh_max: 240, 198
probe_count: 5
scan_overshoot: 8
```

- `scan_overshoot`
  _Default Value: 0 (disabled)_\
  The maximum amount of travel (in mm) available outside of the mesh.
  For rectangular beds this applies to travel on the X axis, and for round beds
  it applies to the entire radius.  The tool must be able to travel the amount
  specified outside of the mesh.  This value is used to optimize the travel
  path when performing a "rapid scan".  The minimum value that may be specified
  is 1.  The default is no overshoot.

If no scan overshoot is configured then travel path optimization will not
be applied to changes in direction.

# Extras & Notes

### START PRINT Macro

- Add the following to your start print macro to enable adaptive bed mesh using Eddy
```
BED_MESH_CALIBRATE SCAN_MODE=rapid METHOD=scan ADAPTIVE=1
```

# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

### Eddy is performing Z Hops when running Bed Mesh
- Make sure you are using the correct macro call.
```BED_MESH_CALIBRATE SCAN_MODE=rapid METHOD=scan```
- Remove or alter KAMP - Adaptive Bed Mesh and any custom BED_MESH_CALIBRATE macros. Use klipper adaptive mesh instead or alternatively do not include KAMP/Adaptive_Meshing.cfg in your KAMP_Settings.cfg
[Information on Adaptive Mesh Here](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Mesh.html#adaptive-meshes)

### Which Eddy version should I use?
- It depends on your needs. Eddy USB and Eddy Coil are nearly identical, however Eddy Coil is more for toolhead boards and connects via I2C connectors.
- Eddy Coil cannot be used for z-homing as a z-endstop as it doesnt feature temperature compensation.

### My z-offset doesnt seem to save and resets, is there a work around or fix?
- Currently there doesnt seem to be a proper fix however if you insert the following into your PRINT_START, CANCEL and END_PRINT macros, you can manually specify your z offset.
> [!WARNING]
> This can have serious consequences if you don't know what youre doing. Your nozzle can crash into the bed if you set this wrong. Please do so at YOUR OWN RISK.

```
//start print
SET_GCODE_OFFSET Z=-0.6 #adjust value to your liking to drop your z-offset height a little more

// cancel + end print
SET_GCODE_OFFSET Z=0 #
```
# Known Issues
- BTT Knomi will cause z-hops, please edit you KNOMI.CFG specifically this line.
  ```
  SET_GCODE_VARIABLE MACRO=_KNOMI_STATUS VARIABLE=probing VALUE=True
  BTT_BED_MESH_CALIBRATE
  SET_GCODE_VARIABLE MACRO=_KNOMI_STATUS VARIABLE=probing VALUE=False
  ```
  
  so that it looks like this
  ```
  SET_GCODE_VARIABLE MACRO=_KNOMI_STATUS VARIABLE=probing VALUE=True
  BTT_BED_MESH_CALIBRATE SCAN_MODE=rapid METHOD=scan
  SET_GCODE_VARIABLE MACRO=_KNOMI_STATUS VARIABLE=probing VALUE=False
  ```
