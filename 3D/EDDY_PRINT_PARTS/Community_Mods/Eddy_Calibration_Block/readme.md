Calibration Block for BTT Eddy probe v1 ( USB probe version )

Designed by @DaveTheBuskerUK - 20240510

I created this two step block to quickly configure the height adjustment for the Eddy probe, it's meant to be around 1 to 2mm higher than the tip of the nozzle, so with the nozzle just touching the build surface you can place the shorter pad on the block under the Eddy probe and adjust the slide until the Eddy probe is just touching the block, then with the two bolts tightened you can manually raise z up until the taller pad on the block can sit under the Eddy probe, that puts the probe at about 20mm above the build surface for it's intitial calibration.
