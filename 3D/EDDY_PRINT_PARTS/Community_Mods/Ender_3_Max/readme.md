Adjustable mount for BTT Eddy probe v1 ( USB probe version ) to fit Creality Ender 3 Max carriage plate

Designed by @DaveTheBuskerUK - 20240510

There are 2 parts to the actual mount -

The slide has holes in it for the supplied M3 bolts that come with the Eddy probe, I use the shorter 2, the holes are sized to self tap when you screw in the m3 bolts, if they pull out you could use the longer bolts with nylock nuts on the back of the slide. At the top of the slide is a pair of larger holes for a cable tie to retain the probe cable. Then the long slotted hole is for 2 M3x10mm bolts which go through the slide, through the spacer and fit into the threaded holes in the E3 Max carriage plate, these allow for vertical adjustment of the probe.

The spacer fits between the slide and the carriage plate, this is needed to offset the slide so it doesn't collide with the bolts on the belt adjuster. I created a recess in the spacer so it also helps the slide not drift sideways and should keep it at 90 degrees to the bed.

I also created the block, I used this to quickly configure the height adjustment for the Eddy probe, it's meant to be around 1 to 2mm higher than the tip of the nozzle, so with the nozzle just touching the build surface you can place the shorter pad on the block under the Eddy probe and adjust the slide until the Eddy probe is just touching the block, then with the two bolts tightened you can manually raise z up until the taller pad on the block can sit under the Eddy probe, that puts the probe at about 20mm above the build surface for it's intitial calibration. The blcok can be found in the Eddy_Calibration_Block folder if you are reading this on GitHub.

I printed all 3 parts in PLA, 0.20mm layer height, 23% infill and added 2 m3X10mm button head bolts for mounting.

This puts the probe offsets at about 50 x and 5 y but you will need to measure your own install to check.
